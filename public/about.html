        <h1>About the Harlem Renaissance</h1>
        <p>
            The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural, social, and artistic movement that took place in Harlem, New York, during the 1920s and 1930s.
            It was a golden age for African American culture, fostering literary, musical, and artistic expressions that reshaped American identity.

        <p>
            This movement saw the rise of legendary figures such as <b>Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Duke Ellington,</b> and many more.
            The Harlem Renaissance wasn't just about artâ€”it was about identity, pride, and the fight for racial equality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jazz music, poetry, and intellectual thought flourished, influencing generations to come.
            This era laid the foundation for the Civil Rights Movement and remains a crucial part of American history.
